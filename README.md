# Linked List + Dynamic Array (2/15)
- Read in a list of names and sort them alphabetically. (Imagine they're users). 
- Implement the sort yourself, do not rely on built in sort functions. 
- Provide a function to check if a name is in this list.

### Getting Started
You can either fork or clone this repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/serpient/simple-boilerplate.git my-app-name
cd my-app-name
npm install
live-server
```

### Starting Live Server
1. Navigate to the root folder (example, `simple-boilerplate/`)
2. Run `live-server`
3. Let it up open a local environment in your browser
4. Any changes in your files related to `index.html` will be seen in your browser

### Deployment to Github Pages

2. Go to your browser and check out `http://<YourUsername>.github.io/<yourRepoName>`. Give it a few minutes to see your changes!

### Deployment to Heroku
If you want to deploy to Heroku, it would require you to write a small simple server that would serve the `index.html` file as an entry point. This boilerplate isn't setup for that, but feel free to add it yourself!
